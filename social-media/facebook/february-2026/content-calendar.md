## Week 1: February 3-7

### Monday, Feb 3 - IT Security Tip 🔐

**Post:**
```
🔐 IT Security Tip #1: Password Edition

Still using "Company123" as your business password? Here's why that's a problem:

❌ 81% of data breaches involve weak passwords
❌ Hackers can crack simple passwords in seconds
❌ One breach can cost small businesses $200K+

✅ What to do instead:
• Use a password manager (we recommend Bitwarden - it's free!)
• Enable 2-factor authentication on EVERYTHING
• Never reuse passwords across accounts

Your business data is worth protecting. Need help securing your systems? We offer free IT assessments for Philly-area small businesses.

### Wednesday, Feb 5 - Service Spotlight: Cloud VoIP ☁️📞

**Post:**

☁️📞 Ditch the Expensive Phone System

Cloud VoIP gives your small business:
✅ Professional phone system - no hardware needed
✅ Use your computer or smartphone as your business line
✅ Call forwarding, voicemail-to-email, conference calls
✅ Pay per user, not per phone line
✅ Work from anywhere - office, home, or on the road

One of our clients cut their phone bill by 60% while ADDING features they never had before.

## Week 2: February 10-14

### Monday, Feb 10 - IT Tip: Backups 💾

**Post:**
```
💾 IT Tip #2: The 3-2-1 Backup Rule

If your computer died right now, would you lose everything?

For small businesses, data loss isn't just inconvenient—it can be catastrophic. 60% of small businesses that lose their data shut down within 6 months.

The 3-2-1 Rule protects you:
3️⃣ Keep 3 copies of your data
2️⃣ Store on 2 different types of media
1️⃣ Keep 1 copy offsite (cloud backup!)

What should you back up?
• Customer databases
• Financial records
• Emails and documents
• Point of sale data
• Everything you can't afford to lose

We set up automated cloud backups that run in the background—you'll never think about it until you need it.

🛡️ Don't wait for disaster. Let's talk backup solutions.

### Wednesday, Feb 12 - Service Spotlight: Network Infrastructure 🌐

**Post:**
```
🌐 Is Your Business Network Holding You Back?

Slow WiFi. Dropped connections. That one corner of the office with no signal.

Sound familiar?

Your network is the backbone of everything:
• Credit card processing
• Cloud apps and email
• VoIP phones
• Security cameras
• Customer WiFi

We build networks sized for small business:
✅ Business-grade firewalls (not consumer routers!)
✅ Managed switches for reliability
✅ Enterprise WiFi that actually covers your space
✅ Clean, professional cabling

No enterprise complexity. No inflated pricing. Just solid infrastructure that works.

📍 Serving Montgomery, Bucks, Chester & Delaware Counties

💝 Happy Valentine's Day from Penn Tech Solutions!

Here's what we LOVE about small business owners:

❤️ Your hustle and determination
❤️ How you support your local community

💔 Ransomware attacks
💔 Surprise IT bills
💔 "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" support
💔 Tech that slows you down

You deserve an IT partner who cares about YOUR success.

Happy Valentine's Day, Philly! 🏙️❤️

## Week 3: February 17-21

### Monday, Feb 17 - IT Tip: Phishing Awareness 🎣

**Post:**
```
🎣 IT Tip #3: Don't Take the Bait

That email from "Microsoft" asking you to verify your account? Probably fake.

Phishing attacks are the #1 way hackers get into small businesses. And they're getting SCARY good at it.

🚨 Red flags to watch for:
• Urgent language ("Act NOW or lose access!")
• Sender email doesn't match the company
• Hovering over links shows weird URLs
• Asking for passwords or payment info
• Generic greetings ("Dear Customer")

✅ What to do:
• When in doubt, don't click
• Call the company directly using a known number
• Train your whole team to spot fakes
• Use email filtering (we can help!)

One wrong click can cost your business thousands. We offer security awareness training for small teams.

Stay safe out there! 🛡️
