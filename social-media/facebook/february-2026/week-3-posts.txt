🎣 IT Tip #3: Don't Take the Bait

That email from "Microsoft" asking you to verify your account? Probably fake.

Phishing attacks are the #1 way hackers get into small businesses. And they're getting SCARY good at it.

🚨 Red flags to watch for:
• Urgent language ("Act NOW or lose access!")
• Sender email doesn't match the company
• Hovering over links shows weird URLs
• Asking for passwords or payment info
• Generic greetings ("Dear Customer")

✅ What to do:
• When in doubt, don't click
• Call the company directly using a known number
• Train your whole team to spot fakes
• Use email filtering (we can help!)

One wrong click can cost your business thousands. We offer security awareness training for small teams.

Stay safe out there! 🛡️

"We were paying way too much for an outdated phone system that barely worked. Penn Tech Solutions moved us to cloud VoIP in ONE DAY. 

Now our team can take calls from anywhere, our customers get professional greetings, and we're saving money every month. Should've done this years ago!"
