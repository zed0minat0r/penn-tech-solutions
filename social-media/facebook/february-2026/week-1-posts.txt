🔐 IT Security Tip #1: Password Edition

Still using "Company123" as your business password? Here's why that's a problem:

❌ 81% of data breaches involve weak passwords
❌ Hackers can crack simple passwords in seconds
❌ One breach can cost small businesses $200K+

✅ What to do instead:
• Use a password manager (we recommend Bitwarden - it's free!)
• Enable 2-factor authentication on EVERYTHING
• Never reuse passwords across accounts

Your business data is worth protecting. Need help securing your systems? We offer free IT assessments for Philly-area small businesses.
