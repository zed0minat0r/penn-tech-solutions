💾 IT Tip #2: The 3-2-1 Backup Rule

If your computer died right now, would you lose everything?

For small businesses, data loss isn't just inconvenient—it can be catastrophic. 60% of small businesses that lose their data shut down within 6 months.

The 3-2-1 Rule protects you:
3️⃣ Keep 3 copies of your data
2️⃣ Store on 2 different types of media
1️⃣ Keep 1 copy offsite (cloud backup!)

What should you back up?
• Customer databases
• Financial records
• Emails and documents
• Point of sale data
• Everything you can't afford to lose

We set up automated cloud backups that run in the background—you'll never think about it until you need it.

🛡️ Don't wait for disaster. Let's talk backup solutions.

WEDNESDAY, FEB 12 - Service Spotlight: Network Infrastructure
Schedule for: 12:00 PM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🌐 Is Your Business Network Holding You Back?

Slow WiFi. Dropped connections. That one corner of the office with no signal.

Sound familiar?

Your network is the backbone of everything:
• Credit card processing
• Cloud apps and email
• VoIP phones
• Security cameras
• Customer WiFi

We build networks sized for small business:
✅ Business-grade firewalls (not consumer routers!)
✅ Managed switches for reliability
✅ Enterprise WiFi that actually covers your space
✅ Clean, professional cabling

No enterprise complexity. No inflated pricing. Just solid infrastructure that works.

📍 Serving Montgomery, Bucks, Chester & Delaware Counties
